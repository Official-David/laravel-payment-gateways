# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-payment-gateways` will be documented in this file.

## 0.0.4 - 2022-06-14

I would have tagged this significant release with lots of breaking changes, but thanks to God, we still don't have a stable release.

In this release, I reworked the hosted providers to generate the checkout URL from the gateway providers.

Completed the implementation for the following providers:

- Paystack ðŸ”¥
- Flutterwave ðŸ”¥
- Stripe ðŸ”¥

That's all for now, more implementation is coming for Monnify and Paypal ðŸš€
